      <p>My name is Matthew Albrecht (Mattparks), I am a self taught 16 year old computer software developer who is always looking to learn more about computers. Recently I have been developing a 3D game engine and last year I was making minecraft mods such as 4Space or Minestellar. I try to make my games / mods as realistic as possible without sacrificing gameplay. In addition all of my code is open source. I find making minecraft mods a great way to learn Java and I'm very proud with my work, but my work would be completely worthless to me if other people did not like it too. That is why I am always looking for suggestions and also help in development.</p>
