      <h3>Web Development</h3>
      <p>I began web development for personal projects in middle school, but in high school I was able to take a class on it.
        The class only covered basic CSS, HTML, and JavaScript but it gave a lot of professional usage scenarios and was a fun class.
        Sence then I have learned to use Gulp and Jade to speed up development, along with using Jade at times to replace HTML and SCSS to replace CSS.
        I now have my own custom theme for my newer developments called <a href="http://mattyparks.com/FlatMatt-Theme/" targe="_blank"> The FlatMatt Theme</a>.
        Along with CSS3 animations I have learned jQuery animations, this site features these animations all over the place!

      <h3>Leadership</h3>
      <p>I have worked within many teams such as 4Space, Minestellar, Theta Core, and Team 537 code.
        After working with, and leading some of these groups for a few years I have learned how to work with many people across borders, languages and ability's.
        One of the best leadership tips I have learned is to assigning tasks to people who can accomplish the task well, and maybe learn something new along the way.
        Organizing tasks is essential to leadership, I it easy with Trello, for all groups I manage I use this amazing tool, whether it for tasks, updates or communication.
        I enjoy working though problems with team mates and clients, I find this to be the most fun part about leaderships.

      <h3>Application Usages</h3>
      <p>For all development I use git to backup changes and to colaborate.
        I will ether use Github or Bitbucket for this, but for a few projects I have hosted repositories on a local server.
        For web development I use Atom along with Gulp for compiling and writing code, and with the languages Java and C++ I use Eclipse and Intellij.
        To create images and design web page mockups I use Photoshop, Paint.Net, and Illustrator.
        I have experience in Linux, as I use it every day on my main laptop and for servers.
