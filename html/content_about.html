      <hr/><br/>
      <p>I am a self taught 16 year old computer software developer who is always looking to learn more about computers.
        Recently I have been developing websites and a 3D Game Engine, but just a few years ago I was making Minecraft mods such as 4Space and Minestellar.
        I try to make my games / mods as realistic as possible without sacrificing gameplay.
        In addition all of my code is open source on <a href="https://github.com/mattparks" target="_blank">My Github</a>.
        I learned how to program by making Minecraft mods, is a great way to learn Java and getting to learn a first computer language.
        I'm very proud with my work, but my work would be completely worthless to me if other people did not like it too.
        That is why I am always looking for suggestions and also help in development.</p>
